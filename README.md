# Minecraft Anvil Combinator

This tool calculates the optimal way to combine items on a minecraft anvil. Mostly used for getting the cheapest enchantment combination costs.

Successor of https://github.com/Trombecher/mc-anvil-combinator. This newer version is built with [Aena](https://github.com/Trombecher/aena) and therefore much faster and smaller (whole app: ~10kb gzipped).
